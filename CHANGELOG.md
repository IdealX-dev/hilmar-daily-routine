# Changelog — Hilmar Daily Tracker

Per the working standard (CLAUDE.md): every session logs its decisions here,
by name, so the next session starts current. Newest first.

## 2026-07-14 — Zero unresolved/unmapped lanes (run 29292014093 root cause)

Michael: "your qc doesn't work and isn't working properly" + "there should be
zero unresolved lanes / unmapped." Production log:
`LANE-DIAG stand_260905: unresolved — pod=Unknown; pdf_fields_present=no`.
Root cause: the row carried the LITERAL string "Unknown" in `pod`, persisted
in tracking-data-v2.json from a fire BEFORE the pdf_parser `_clean_port`
source-fix. It re-derived unresolved every fire (the recurring drift), rendered
"Lane unresolved" in the staff email AND the now-live client email to Lonny,
and produced an "Unmapped" trade-region row — while QC-015 printed GREEN
"within tolerance". Four structural fixes, all at the root; gates green
(compileall, ruff, pytest 1652 passed — was 1642 + 10 new tests).

- **FIX 1 — heal the poisoned literal on load** (`scripts/qc_selfheal.py`
  phase_3_entries; mirrored byte-consistently into `src/hilmar/qc.py`
  phase_3_entries per QC-040 spirit). New `_GARBAGE_PLACEHOLDERS` frozenset +
  `_is_placeholder(v)`. For every request, a placeholder literal
  ("unknown"/"n/a"/"na"/"none"/"null"/"tbd"/"-"/"—"/"") in `pod`/`destination`/
  `origin` (case-insensitive) is coerced to None BEFORE lane derivation, so it
  can never display, defeat `patch_carriers._dest_from_row_pod`/`_dest_from_pod`
  (a truthy "Unknown" looked resolved), or bucket the row "Unmapped". Logs a
  `log.fix` naming the row id + field. Kills the drift at the source.
- **FIX 2 — client report never renders an unresolved row**
  (`scripts/gen_client_email.py`). New module-level `_lane_resolved(r)`; every
  section bucket in `_client_sections` and `_active_shipments` filters through
  it. A row with no displayable lane (placeholder destination AND no real lane,
  or lane == "Lane unresolved") is excluded from ALL client sections. Empty
  sections use the existing collapse. Lonny sees only resolved shipments.
- **FIX 3 — QC-015 fails LOUDLY on a rendered unresolved row**
  (`scripts/qc_selfheal.py`). Contract rewritten: ERRORs when ANY unresolved
  row WOULD render client-facing — a WIN inside the client email's 14-day
  active-shipments window (mirrors `gen_client_email._active_shipments`) OR any
  today-dated staff-section row. "within tolerance" GREEN is reachable ONLY
  when every unresolved row is a non-rendered historical-tail row; the count-
  based WARN/ERROR map tiers survive for that tail. Error names the offending
  row ids + pod/dest/subject. QC-INDEX.md row updated.
- **FIX 4 — exclude unresolved-destination rows from the CLIENT trade-region
  rollup** (`scripts/core.py` + `scripts/gen_pdf.py`). New
  `is_unresolved_destination(dest)` + `aggregate_trade_regions(...,
  include_unresolved=True)`. Default keeps rows (STAFF/QC totals reconcile to
  summary exactly as before); gen_pdf (client-facing) passes
  `include_unresolved=False` so a healed None/placeholder destination never
  renders a mystery "Unmapped" region, reconciled by a "+N pending lane
  assignment" footnote. gen_email (staff) and gen_dashboard (internal)
  intentionally keep the reconciling default — staff MAY surface the needs-lane
  count.

DEFERRED BY DESIGN: stand_260905's TRUE lane is genuinely underivable from
in-window data — a separate operator task, out of scope. It correctly remains
unresolved in the STAFF view; it no longer appears in the CLIENT email/PDF, and
QC-015 now ERRORs on it so the operator is flagged to assign the real lane.

## 2026-07-12 — Client report GO-LIVE (operator decision)

Michael Deitchman approved go-live via the session decision prompt
(option "Client report go-live"), after explicitly declining the request
to add lupfold@hilmaringredients.com to the internal staff full_list
(that would have sent OL's negotiation analytics to the client; refused,
QC-065 continues to enforce the separation). One-line reversible config
flip: client_report.enabled false -> true. From the next production fire
Lonny receives the redesigned client service report daily (cc
michael.deitchman@ol-usa.com, own client-sent idempotency flag + mailbox
guard); samples to sample_to stop. Rollback = flip enabled back to false.
Gate-pinning test updated to lock the LIVE state.

## 2026-07-12 — Session: four fixes from the Friday-evening fire (run 29174327034)

Michael's review of the Friday-evening production fire (run 29174327034,
~8:50 PM ET — the runner's UTC clock already into Saturday) surfaced four
defects. All four fixed at the root; gates green (compileall, ruff, pytest
1641 passed — was 1610 + 30 new tests + 1 net in test_client_email.py).

- **Client email subject report-day derivation hardened**
  (`scripts/gen_client_email.py`): the sample's subject dated the wrong
  day. `build_subject` and `build_body` each read the wall clock
  SEPARATELY and neither accepted an injected instant, so the subject
  could drift from the body and the UTC-vs-ET shift around midnight was
  untestable. Both now derive from ONE aware instant (new `_now_et`
  helper, `now=` keyword; `main()` passes a single shared instant)
  through `gen_email._report_date → core.report_business_day` — the exact
  staff-email path (wee-hours rollback + weekend→Friday). Pinned by
  tests: evening-ET/next-day-UTC, 00:40 ET wee-hours, weekend roll, and
  staff-email parity. CALENDAR NOTE, logged honestly: in the proleptic
  Gregorian calendar Python uses, 2026-07-11 is a Saturday (Friday that
  week is 2026-07-10), so the fire instant Michael reported as "Friday
  Jul 11" evaluates as a Saturday-ET run and the weekend roll (Sat→Fri
  Jul 10) explains the "(Jul 10, 2026)" subject; tests pin the intended
  scenario shapes on the real-calendar dates.
- **Weekly summary Friday gate is now ET + injectable**
  (`scripts/gen_weekly_summary.py`): the gate is evaluated on the
  America/New_York fire day derived from one aware instant (new
  `_fire_day_et` + `should_generate`), never the runner's UTC/local
  date, and honors the same midnight–6 AM ET wee-hours rollback as
  `core.report_business_day` (a 1 AM ET Saturday run is Friday's
  very-late fire and now generates instead of skipping). `--force`
  behavior kept; `main(argv, now)` is test-injectable. Tests: Fri-evening
  ET/Sat-UTC must not skip, actual Saturday ET skips, force overrides.
- **POD literal "Unknown" + PASS 2b short-circuit**
  (`scripts/patch_carriers.py`, `scripts/pdf_parser.py`): the run log had
  NO LANE-DIAG line for stand_260905 because `if not parsed: continue`
  skipped the PASS 2b block (and its diagnostic) for every row whose
  bodies parse to nothing. PASS 1/2 now run under `if parsed:` and PASS
  2b + LANE-DIAG run for ALL rows (r["pod"] can already sit on the row
  from a prior fire). `_dest_from_pod` explicitly treats
  "Unknown"/"unknown"/"" as absent; new `_dest_from_row_pod` also tries
  the parse's POD-shaped aliases (port_of_discharge/discharge_port/
  destination_port/dest_port — "pol" excluded, that's the origin). At
  the source, `pdf_parser.parse_booking_pdf` (new `_clean_port`) never
  emits the literal "Unknown" as a POL/POD value — a placeholder
  "UNKNOWN" cell title-cased to exactly that string. Tests: placeholder
  variants → None, no-parsed-still-diagnoses (capsys LANE-DIAG), lane
  recovery from the row's own pod, pdf_parser synthetic-text fixtures.
- **Client reply-speed metric moved to the Pacific business window** —
  trigger: Michael's timezone report, 2026-07-11: "lonny is uswc and we
  are usec". `core.biz_hours_between` (8:30–17:30 ET) is the STAFF desk
  SLA and is unchanged for all callers; the client email's narrative now
  reflects Lonny's experienced wait. New `core.biz_hours_between_pt`
  (8:30–17:30 America/Los_Angeles, Mon–Fri, DST-safe) shares the loop via
  `_biz_hours_between_window(tz, win_start, win_end)`; **paired change
  mirrored byte-for-byte into `src/hilmar/core.py`** (QC-040; a test now
  locks source parity via inspect.getsource). `gen_client_email`
  narrative computes request→response PT-window hours for TODAY's quotes
  (never the stored turnaround_biz_hours) plus the same-PT-calendar-day
  share: "… — all the same business day (average 1.4 business hours,
  Pacific)"; parenthetical omitted when no timestamps.
  `gen_manual.METRIC_DEFINITIONS`: "Time to Quote" now states the ET desk
  window; new "Client reply time (PT)" entry (drift-guard tests green).
  Cross-coast expected values verified against the real constants:
  request 2026-07-08T23:30Z (4:30 PM PT / 7:30 PM ET Wed) → response
  2026-07-09T12:45Z (5:45 AM PT / 8:45 AM ET Thu) gives ET-window
  **0.25 h** (Wed after ET close; Thu 8:30→8:45) and PT-window **1.0 h**
  (Wed 4:30→5:30 PM PT; Thu before PT open); same-day share false for
  that pair, true for a mid-day pair.
- New tests: `tests/test_auditfix_fri_evening_fire_tz.py` (30);
  `tests/test_client_email.py` narrative tests rewritten for the PT
  metric (+1 net). Untouched per scope: outlook_send.py, config.json,
  QC-065 constants, workflows, gen_email.py staff Time-to-Quote.

## 2026-07-11 — Session: client daily email redesigned as a premium service update

Michael reviewed the client-facing daily sample and called it "terrible" —
`scripts/gen_client_email.py` rebuilt as a premium logistics service update
for Lonny Upfold (Hilmar Ingredients). All safety invariants preserved:
same artifacts (`reports/client-email-{body.html,subject.txt}`), same subject
format, same `--data/--out-dir/--config` CLI, QC-065 leak scan clean, CID
logo, inline-styles/solid-header Outlook rules, shared gen_email helpers
(escape-once, Windows-portable strftime, report-day math). gen_email.py,
outlook_send.py, config.json, QC-065 constants, and workflows untouched.

Shipped (working tree, this branch):
- **Hero KPI strip** — 4 tiles (Requests received / Quotes delivered /
  Bookings confirmed / Awaiting your decision, each count + TEU) reusing
  `gen_email._kpi_card`, so the td.hx-kpi display:block full-width mobile
  stacking is shared code, not a copy (never inline-block/50%).
- **Service narrative** — one line under the tiles ("We received 3 rate
  requests and returned 3 quotes (average 1.4 business hours); 1 booking
  confirmed."); the avg comes from today's quoted rows'
  `turnaround_biz_hours` and the parenthetical is omitted when absent.
- **Active shipments** (new section) — WIN rows from the last 14 days
  (request_date, fallback response_timestamp): Lane · Carrier · Booking ref
  (mdolx_ref, else "Confirmation to follow") · Vessel (vessel_voyage) ·
  ETD · ETA · Doc cutoff, sorted by ETD ascending. stand_* bookings included
  here (the honest client-facing event).
- **Upcoming cutoffs callout** (new) — amber box listing active shipments
  with doc_cutoff (fallback: etd_offered → "vessel departs") within the next
  7 days; dates parsed defensively, unparseable skipped, box hidden when
  empty.
- **Empty-section collapse** — zero-row daily sections render one friendly
  line ("No new rate requests today.") instead of an empty table; "Awaiting
  your decision" always tables when it has rows (client's action list). A
  fully quiet day still composes: tiles (zeros) + narrative + footer.
- **Polish** — header subtitle tightened to "Prepared by OL-USA · <day> ·
  Updated <time> ET"; alternating row striping (inline bgcolor, Outlook-safe);
  nowrap navy headers; footer adds "Questions about a specific shipment?
  Reply with the booking reference."
- **Tests**: `tests/test_client_email.py` 20 → 29 (hero tile counts,
  active-shipments window/sort/refs, cutoff in/out of horizon + junk dates,
  quiet-day collapse with leak scan, mobile-CSS regression guard pinning
  display:block and banning inline-block/50%, subject pinned exactly).
  Full suite: 1610 passed.
- NOT done deliberately: production `PROJECT HILMAR/scripts/` mirror copy
  (QC-040) — this session works the repo tree only; mirror on deploy.

## 2026-07-11 — Session: insights engine wired into the production pipeline

Implements the "Insights engine wired" line item announced under 2026-07-10
(the modules existed since 2026-04/05 per docs/INSIGHTS-DESIGN.md but were
only reachable from the dormant src/hilmar/orchestrator.py path — the
scripts/ pipeline that actually fires daily never invoked them).

Shipped (working tree, this branch):
- **`scripts/gen_insights.py`** (new): CLI shim — baselines update
  (`hilmar.baselines.update`, persisted next to tracking-data as
  `baselines.json` + grafted in-memory) → `insights.build_context`
  (+ optional qc-result.json / parser_misses.jsonl enrichment) →
  `insights.generate_narrative` via `ModelRouter` (defaults untouched:
  Opus, env dial-down, 429 cascade). Writes
  `reports/insights/<date>.{json,html}` + the two embed snippets
  `reports/insights-business.html` (staff) / `insights-full.html` (audit).
  Prints daily LLM spend from the router cost log; loud WARN above
  `HILMAR_INSIGHTS_COST_ALERT_CENTS` (default 200¢). EXITS 0 ON EVERY
  PATH — missing ANTHROPIC_API_KEY / API down / crash all degrade to a
  skipped narrative with the rule-based context still written.
- **`scripts/run_pipeline.py`**: new step "Daily insights (baselines + LLM)"
  inserted directly before "Email body HTML" (gen_email embeds its output);
  classified BEST_EFFORT; 480s step timeout (4 sequential Opus calls).
- **`scripts/gen_email.py`**: staff daily embeds insights-business.html as
  "🤖 AI Insights — Business" before the footer — only when the file's
  mtime is from today (stale-yesterday never renders), non-empty, ≤40KB;
  any failure renders nothing. Business-only per Michael 2026-04-28.
- **`scripts/gen_improvements_report.py`**: idealx.us audit embeds
  insights-full.html (all four sections), mirroring the
  rate-intelligence inline pattern + the same mtime-today freshness guard.
- **`scripts/gen_manual.py`**: "AI Insights — Business" added to the email
  section catalog (drift-guard test forces manual coverage); dropped an
  unused import that was failing ruff.
- **Tests**: `tests/test_gen_insights_wiring.py` (16 tests, LLM fully
  mocked — no Anthropic client is ever constructed). Suite: 1599 passed.

Decisions (Claude session, per locked spec — no operator input needed):
- baselines.json + llm-cost-log.jsonl live NEXT TO tracking-data-v2.json
  (repo root in the GitHub-Actions deploy), matching the
  orchestrator.step_baselines convention; HILMAR_LLM_COST_LOG still
  overrides the cost-log path.
- The shim grafts baselines in-memory only — it does NOT write
  tracking-data-v2.json (QC already ran by this pipeline stage; a
  best-effort step must not mutate the canonical data file).
- Missing-key check happens BEFORE any router call: client construction
  without a key raises outside the router's own 429/connection cascade,
  so the shim skips upfront rather than relying on that path.

## 2026-07-10 — Session: client email, zero unresolved lanes, analytics lit up

Operator decisions (Michael Deitchman):
- CLAUDE.md replaced with the Ideal-X working standard (PR #88; pipeline
  manual preserved in git history at main@1857c36).
- Client-facing daily email approved to build, SHIPS GATED OFF — go-live is
  the `client_report.enabled` flip, pending his review of real-data samples.
- "Zero unresolved lanes" set as the standard for the daily email.
- Queued: full cost-efficiency review (Anthropic tokens + Microsoft/Azure).

Shipped (PRs #85–#88 merged to main; analytics PR follows):
- **Client email** (`gen_client_email.py`): service-update-only content,
  QC-065 hard-pins recipients (to=lupfold@hilmaringredients.com,
  cc=michael.deitchman@ol-usa.com) + scans for internal-analytics leaks;
  sample goes to Michael only while gated; own `client-sent` idempotency
  flag + cross-host mailbox guard.
- **Lane resolution**: standalone booking amendments now take their lane
  from the booking-PDF Port of Discharge (`patch_carriers` PASS 2b,
  KNOWN_DESTINATIONS-validated). QC-015's "within tolerance" pass for
  unmapped destinations replaced with a hard ERROR on today-dated rows.
- **QC-057 diagnostics + acknowledgments**: every silently-dropped intake
  email now logs PII-scrubbed lane-hinted body lines (QC-057-DIAG); the
  REEFER NEEDS / REEFERS commercial notes (not RFQs — free-time ask,
  transship-options instruction) recorded in date-scoped
  `scripts/intake_acknowledged.json`.
- **User manual** (`gen_manual.py` → user-manual.html): consumer manual
  rebuilt every fire from live config; drift-guard tests tie its catalogs
  to the real gen_email sections and dashboard tabs; attached to the daily
  staff email.
- **Weekly executive summary restored**: it only fired from the retired
  Cloud PC wrapper, so the GitHub-Actions cutover had silently killed it.
  Now a Friday-self-skipping pipeline step; attached to Friday's email when
  fresh.
- **Historian wiring**: daily.yml now passes HILMAR_HISTORIAN_URL/TOKEN and
  installs the libsql client. Store stays dormant until Michael adds the
  two repo secrets (docs/HISTORIAN.md) — owner action.
- **Insights engine wired** (built 2026-04/05 per docs/INSIGHTS-DESIGN.md,
  never invoked): baselines + rule-based context + LLM narrative now run as
  a best-effort pipeline step; Business section embeds in the staff email,
  all four sections in Michael's audit email; cost telemetry + $2/day alert
  per the locked spec.

Known-open (owner: Michael unless noted):
- Repo is PUBLIC on GitHub — code/docs expose client + business details;
  recommend flipping to private (Settings → Change visibility).
- Turso secrets not yet set — no longitudinal rate/win history accumulates
  until they are.
- Client email go-live flip pending sample review.
- Cost-efficiency review queued (Claude: run after insights cost telemetry
  accumulates a few days).
- Yokohama ×2 rate rows still missing carriers (sibling quotes disagreed);
  QC-056 diagnostics continue to surface them.
