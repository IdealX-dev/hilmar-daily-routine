# Changelog — Hilmar Daily Tracker

Per the working standard (CLAUDE.md): every session logs its decisions here,
by name, so the next session starts current. Newest first.

## 2026-07-11 — Session: insights engine wired into the production pipeline

Implements the "Insights engine wired" line item announced under 2026-07-10
(the modules existed since 2026-04/05 per docs/INSIGHTS-DESIGN.md but were
only reachable from the dormant src/hilmar/orchestrator.py path — the
scripts/ pipeline that actually fires daily never invoked them).

Shipped (working tree, this branch):
- **`scripts/gen_insights.py`** (new): CLI shim — baselines update
  (`hilmar.baselines.update`, persisted next to tracking-data as
  `baselines.json` + grafted in-memory) → `insights.build_context`
  (+ optional qc-result.json / parser_misses.jsonl enrichment) →
  `insights.generate_narrative` via `ModelRouter` (defaults untouched:
  Opus, env dial-down, 429 cascade). Writes
  `reports/insights/<date>.{json,html}` + the two embed snippets
  `reports/insights-business.html` (staff) / `insights-full.html` (audit).
  Prints daily LLM spend from the router cost log; loud WARN above
  `HILMAR_INSIGHTS_COST_ALERT_CENTS` (default 200¢). EXITS 0 ON EVERY
  PATH — missing ANTHROPIC_API_KEY / API down / crash all degrade to a
  skipped narrative with the rule-based context still written.
- **`scripts/run_pipeline.py`**: new step "Daily insights (baselines + LLM)"
  inserted directly before "Email body HTML" (gen_email embeds its output);
  classified BEST_EFFORT; 480s step timeout (4 sequential Opus calls).
- **`scripts/gen_email.py`**: staff daily embeds insights-business.html as
  "🤖 AI Insights — Business" before the footer — only when the file's
  mtime is from today (stale-yesterday never renders), non-empty, ≤40KB;
  any failure renders nothing. Business-only per Michael 2026-04-28.
- **`scripts/gen_improvements_report.py`**: idealx.us audit embeds
  insights-full.html (all four sections), mirroring the
  rate-intelligence inline pattern + the same mtime-today freshness guard.
- **`scripts/gen_manual.py`**: "AI Insights — Business" added to the email
  section catalog (drift-guard test forces manual coverage); dropped an
  unused import that was failing ruff.
- **Tests**: `tests/test_gen_insights_wiring.py` (16 tests, LLM fully
  mocked — no Anthropic client is ever constructed). Suite: 1599 passed.

Decisions (Claude session, per locked spec — no operator input needed):
- baselines.json + llm-cost-log.jsonl live NEXT TO tracking-data-v2.json
  (repo root in the GitHub-Actions deploy), matching the
  orchestrator.step_baselines convention; HILMAR_LLM_COST_LOG still
  overrides the cost-log path.
- The shim grafts baselines in-memory only — it does NOT write
  tracking-data-v2.json (QC already ran by this pipeline stage; a
  best-effort step must not mutate the canonical data file).
- Missing-key check happens BEFORE any router call: client construction
  without a key raises outside the router's own 429/connection cascade,
  so the shim skips upfront rather than relying on that path.

## 2026-07-10 — Session: client email, zero unresolved lanes, analytics lit up

Operator decisions (Michael Deitchman):
- CLAUDE.md replaced with the Ideal-X working standard (PR #88; pipeline
  manual preserved in git history at main@1857c36).
- Client-facing daily email approved to build, SHIPS GATED OFF — go-live is
  the `client_report.enabled` flip, pending his review of real-data samples.
- "Zero unresolved lanes" set as the standard for the daily email.
- Queued: full cost-efficiency review (Anthropic tokens + Microsoft/Azure).

Shipped (PRs #85–#88 merged to main; analytics PR follows):
- **Client email** (`gen_client_email.py`): service-update-only content,
  QC-065 hard-pins recipients (to=lupfold@hilmaringredients.com,
  cc=michael.deitchman@ol-usa.com) + scans for internal-analytics leaks;
  sample goes to Michael only while gated; own `client-sent` idempotency
  flag + cross-host mailbox guard.
- **Lane resolution**: standalone booking amendments now take their lane
  from the booking-PDF Port of Discharge (`patch_carriers` PASS 2b,
  KNOWN_DESTINATIONS-validated). QC-015's "within tolerance" pass for
  unmapped destinations replaced with a hard ERROR on today-dated rows.
- **QC-057 diagnostics + acknowledgments**: every silently-dropped intake
  email now logs PII-scrubbed lane-hinted body lines (QC-057-DIAG); the
  REEFER NEEDS / REEFERS commercial notes (not RFQs — free-time ask,
  transship-options instruction) recorded in date-scoped
  `scripts/intake_acknowledged.json`.
- **User manual** (`gen_manual.py` → user-manual.html): consumer manual
  rebuilt every fire from live config; drift-guard tests tie its catalogs
  to the real gen_email sections and dashboard tabs; attached to the daily
  staff email.
- **Weekly executive summary restored**: it only fired from the retired
  Cloud PC wrapper, so the GitHub-Actions cutover had silently killed it.
  Now a Friday-self-skipping pipeline step; attached to Friday's email when
  fresh.
- **Historian wiring**: daily.yml now passes HILMAR_HISTORIAN_URL/TOKEN and
  installs the libsql client. Store stays dormant until Michael adds the
  two repo secrets (docs/HISTORIAN.md) — owner action.
- **Insights engine wired** (built 2026-04/05 per docs/INSIGHTS-DESIGN.md,
  never invoked): baselines + rule-based context + LLM narrative now run as
  a best-effort pipeline step; Business section embeds in the staff email,
  all four sections in Michael's audit email; cost telemetry + $2/day alert
  per the locked spec.

Known-open (owner: Michael unless noted):
- Repo is PUBLIC on GitHub — code/docs expose client + business details;
  recommend flipping to private (Settings → Change visibility).
- Turso secrets not yet set — no longitudinal rate/win history accumulates
  until they are.
- Client email go-live flip pending sample review.
- Cost-efficiency review queued (Claude: run after insights cost telemetry
  accumulates a few days).
- Yokohama ×2 rate rows still missing carriers (sibling quotes disagreed);
  QC-056 diagnostics continue to surface them.
